# Svelte Motion `src/context/MotionContext` Directory Documentation

This directory likely defines and manages the core `MotionContext`, which holds the state and configuration specific to a single `motion` component instance.

## Overview

Unlike `MotionConfigContext` which provides shared defaults, `MotionContext` seems to encapsulate the unique properties and state of an individual animated element. This could include its current visual state, variants, transition settings (potentially inherited or overridden from `MotionConfigContext`), and possibly references to its underlying `visualElement` or animation controls. This context is likely established by the logic that creates motion components (e.g., within `createMotionComponent` or a related internal component).

## Files & Components

*   **`create.js`**: Exports a factory function (`createMotionContext`) responsible for creating the actual value object that will be set in the Svelte context for a motion component. This function likely initializes the context value based on the component's props and potentially inherits values from parent contexts like `MotionConfigContext`.
*   **`index.js`**: Exports the necessary functions or types related to `MotionContext`, potentially including the `createMotionContext` function and the Svelte context key itself.
*   **`utils.js`**: Contains utility functions specifically used for creating, managing, or accessing the `MotionContext` value.
*   **`MotionContext.svelte`**: Might be a Svelte component or module involved in consuming or interacting with the established `MotionContext`. Its exact role needs clarification based on usage.
*   **`MotionContextProvider.svelte`**: A Svelte component responsible for setting the `MotionContext` for its children. This is likely used internally within the implementation of `motion` components generated by `createMotionComponent`.
*   **`UseCreateMotionContext.svelte`**: A Svelte component wrapper potentially encapsulating the logic from `create.js`, providing a component-based way to create the motion context value, perhaps used during the setup phase of a motion component.
